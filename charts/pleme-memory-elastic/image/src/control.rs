//! Pure band-control decision logic for `pleme-memory-elastic`.
//!
//! No I/O lives here. Every function is a pure mapping from observed state to
//! a [`Decision`], so the entire control law is unit-testable without a
//! cluster. This is the heart of the bidirectional memory band controller:
//! hold each enrolled target at the setpoint (default 80% used / 20% free) by
//! nudging its memory *limit* in gentle, bounded steps that converge over many
//! single-shot ticks — implementing the memory dimension of
//! [`theory/BREATHABILITY.md`](https://github.com/pleme-io/theory).
//!
//! Two responsibilities:
//!   1. [`decide`] — the bidirectional band law (grow / hold / shrink).
//!   2. [`competing_memory_manager`] — the single-writer invariant: detect any
//!      other field-manager that owns `limits.memory` so the caller can yield
//!      (emit a conflict event) instead of fighting. Two controllers
//!      oscillating one field is the failure mode this forbids.
